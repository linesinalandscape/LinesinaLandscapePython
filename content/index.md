# Lines in a Landscape (TEST SITE v4)

Hi there, I'm Alan and this is my personal home page. In more than a quarter century of online life, I have accumulated a collection of things that I like to think of as "projects": in reality a jumble of disorganised photo galleries, semi-abandoned pages, half-baked ideas, and things that will be really, really great just as soon as I retire from work and have time to work on them. On this site I try to put some kind of shape on all this, as if there was some kind of grand plan all along.

## Explore this site

Please visit the [Blog](blog\index.md) where I write about my current interests, including train travel and hiking. For the moment I mostly write about the province of Málaga in the south of Spain, where I have lived since 2011. In the future I hope to write more about my home country of Ireland.

Or jump straight to [Stations in the South](stations-in-the-south\index.md), a collection of photo essays about train and metro stations in Málaga. 

If you use a feed reader you can follow this site's [feed](feed.xml) to keep up to date. Or if you have a Fediverse account, I usually post updates to <a rel="me" href="https://en.osm.town/@alan">Mastodon</a>.
