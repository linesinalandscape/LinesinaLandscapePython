# Links / Blogroll

These are a few of the blogs and websites that have in some way influenced me in recent years.

## Málaga and Spain
- [Daniel Capilla](https://dcapillae.wordpress.com/ "Daniel Capilla's Blog") is a prolific contributor to OpenStreetMap in Málaga (see below for more on OpenStreetMap). I especially like his [Map of Monuments and Public Art in Málaga](https://umap.openstreetmap.fr/es/map/monumentos-conmemorativos-y-arte-publico-de-malaga_855088 "Map of Monuments and Public Art in Málaga"), both as a guide to discovering the city and as an example of what can be done with OpenStreetMap data and the uMap tool.
- [Las Rutas de Sendericu](https://sendericu.blogspot.com/ "Las Rutas de Sendericu") is a blog about hiking, mainly in Málaga province.
